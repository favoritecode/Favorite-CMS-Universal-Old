## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- System-aware dark mode for the complete core admin interface, installer, installation-success screen, and bundled default public theme.
- One-click accessible light/dark theme controls with browser-persisted preferences.
- Responsive admin navigation for tablet and mobile screens.
- Strong visible keyboard focus states and reduced-motion support across core UI controls.

### Changed
- Refreshed the shared admin design system with professional spacing, surfaces, cards, tables, forms, shadows, hover states, and typography. Because the update is applied in the master layout, all existing core admin screens and plugin-admin screens inherit it without losing features.
- Improved the default public theme with dark surfaces, readable contrast, polished theme controls, and dark-aware forms, pagination, cards, empty states, and headers.
- Increased touch-target usability and improved mobile layout behavior without changing routes, permissions, workflows, or stored content.

### Fixed
- Fixed admin layouts overflowing or becoming difficult to navigate on narrow screens.
- Fixed light-only hard-coded table, form, notice, and selected-row colors becoming unreadable in dark mode.
- Prevented a flash of the wrong color theme by applying the saved preference before styles render.
- Fixed theme toggle state, icon, and accessible label becoming inconsistent after switching modes.
- Added graceful operating-system theme fallback when no preference has been saved.

### Compatibility
- No features, routes, permissions, database fields, themes, plugins, or content workflows were removed.
- Existing installations can upgrade without a database migration.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Dual-Mode Professional Content Editor**:
  - **Visual Mode**: Rich text WYSIWYG editor with format dropdowns (H1–H6, P, Pre), bold/italic/underline/strikethrough styling, alignment, lists, blockquotes, horizontal rules, interactive table builder, link manager, and automatic paste sanitization (stripping MS Word XML junk).
  - **Code Mode**: Syntax-friendly monospace editor with synchronized line-number gutter, Tab indentation handling, quick HTML insert tags, and large content capacity.
  - Seamless bidirectional synchronization between Visual and Code modes.
  - Local browser autosave snapshot every 20 seconds for disaster recovery.
  - Live Theme Preview rendering drafts directly within active theme styling.
- **Role-Aware Large Media System**:
  - Configured role allowances: **7 GB** for Administrators, **500 MB** for Moderators, and **200 MB** for Normal Users / Subscribers.
  - Server technical ceiling detection evaluating `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `memory_limit`, and available disk space.
  - Early HTTP 413 error reporting on `post_max_size` overflows to protect against silent POST truncation.
  - Drag-and-drop file upload zone with real-time percentage and byte upload progress reporting.
  - Direct executable file rejection and double-extension attack defense (`.php.jpg`, etc.).
- **Core Widget Architecture & Theme Layout Customizer**:
  - Modular widget engine with `WidgetInterface`, `AbstractWidget`, `WidgetRegistry`, and `WidgetInstanceManager`.
  - 10 built-in widgets: Search, Recent Posts, Categories, Tags, Navigation Menu, Pages, Custom HTML, Image, Featured Post, Recent Comments.
  - Multi-instance widget support across theme-declared regions (sidebars, multi-column footers, header strips).
  - One-click **Reset to Theme Defaults** restoration.
  - Visual Theme Customizer (`/admin/customize`) with sidebar position toggles (Right, Left, Full Width), custom logo, brand accent color, and homepage section reordering.
- **Public User Signup & Account System**:
  - Dedicated registration endpoints (`/register`, `/signup`, `/admin/register`).
  - Automatic `subscriber` role assignment with `active` status and `password_hash()` encryption.
  - Administrative toggle in **Settings &rarr; General &rarr; Membership** (`allow_registration`).
  - Dynamic theme header navigation displaying **Sign Up** / **Log In** for visitors and **+ Create Post** / **Dashboard** for authenticated users.
- **Content Moderation Workflow**:
  - Normal user post submissions are strictly overridden on the server side to `pending` review.
  - Prevention of client-side privilege escalation (tampering `status=published` is overridden to `pending`).
  - Dedicated **Pending Review** and **Rejected** tabs in `/admin/posts` with live post counters.
  - One-click **Approve** and **Reject** actions in table row actions and inside the post editor sidebar.
  - Moderator role direct publishing capability (`publish_direct`) allowing moderators to publish immediately without review.
- **User Account Lifecycle (Suspension & Bans)**:
  - Account operational statuses: `active`, `suspended`, `banned`.
  - Suspended users are prevented from creating new posts, updating existing posts, or uploading media files.
  - Banned users cannot log in. Active sessions of banned accounts are immediately terminated upon their very next request.
  - Historical posts, media, and comments of suspended or banned accounts remain intact.
  - Administrative user table (`/admin/users`) with status badges, post counts, quick role changes, and suspend/ban/restore actions.
- **Core Architecture & Extensibility**:
  - Service container and lightweight dependency injection framework (`FavoriteCMS\Core\Application`).
  - Idempotent PDO database migration runner maintaining 13 core migrations (`database/migrations/`).
  - Multi-tier persistent installation state with automatic self-healing lock mechanism (`storage/installed.lock`).
  - Priority-based action and filter hook system (`FavoriteCMS\Core\Hook`).
  - Dynamic plugin frontend route registration engine (`FavoriteCMS\Core\Router`).
  - Dynamic admin menu registration engine (`FavoriteCMS\Core\AdminMenu`).
  - Isolated plugin settings storage service (`FavoriteCMS\Models\PluginSetting`).
- **Comprehensive Quality Assurance**:
  - Complete automated test suite expanded to **109 tests and 511 assertions** with 100% pass rate.
  - Full PHP syntax validation (`php -l`) across all production and test files.
